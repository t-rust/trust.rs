This project is not presently active, and indeed may only questionably be
called a project at all. For anything to come of this hypothetical project
requires that one or more persons with interests and ideas to pursue in
relevant areas contribute to it, for which purpose one may enquire via [the
project-wide issue tracker][meta-issues].

But for now? _Fiat voluntas cuniculi Fenestrarum, sicut in Crates.io, et in
IRC._
